description: HyperRail APIs allow approved partners to programmatically access on-ramp, off-ramp, and fiat currency exchange functionality through secure, RESTful endpoints.
---

The **HyperRail API** enables partners to integrate digital asset infrastructure directly into their applications, including fiat on-ramp, off-ramp, and currency exchange operations.

The API is designed using **RESTful principles**, providing predictable endpoints, standard HTTP methods, and structured responses to ensure a smooth developer experience.

### API Design Principles

You can expect the following when working with the HyperRail API:

- **Resource-Oriented Endpoints**  
  Clear and intuitive URLs representing core resources.

- **Standard HTTP Methods & Status Codes**  
  Uses `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` with conventional response codes.

- **JSON Request & Response Format**  
  All responses are returned in JSON for easy parsing and integration.

- **Consistent Content-Type Handling**  
  Requests should include `Content-Type: application/json`.

### Authentication

All API requests require authentication using your **API keys**.  
These keys identify your application and determine whether requests are processed in test or live mode.

You can find and manage your API keys from the **API Keys & Webhooks** section of your HyperRail dashboard. Each endpoint includes examples showing how to properly authenticate requests.
