## Hyperrial API Response Codes

Hyperrial uses standard HTTP response codes to communicate the outcome of API requests. Always inspect both the **HTTP status code** and the **response body** to fully understand what happened.

### Success (2xx)

- **200 OK**  
  The request was processed successfully.  
  ⚠️ Always inspect the response payload to confirm the actual transaction state.

- **201 Created**  
  A new resource was successfully created (e.g., transactions, accounts, or configurations).

---

### Client Errors (4xx)

- **400 Bad Request**  
  The request is malformed or missing required parameters.  
  ✔️ Validate request payloads and data types.

- **401 Unauthorized**  
  Authentication failed due to a missing or invalid API key.  
  ✔️ Ensure your API key is included in the `Authorization` header.

- **403 Forbidden**  
  The API key does not have permission to perform the requested action.  
  ✔️ Verify the key’s scope or assigned role.

- **404 Not Found**  
  The requested resource does not exist or the endpoint is incorrect.

- **429 Too Many Requests**  
  Rate limit exceeded.  
  ✔️ Implement retry logic with exponential backoff.

---

### Server Errors (5xx)

- **500, 502, 503, 504**  
  These indicate internal server errors on Hyperrial’s infrastructure.  
  ✔️ Treat the outcome as inconclusive and retry later.  
  ✔️ If persistent, contact support.

## Error Handling Best Practices

Beyond HTTP status codes, Hyperrial responses may include structured error objects with additional context such as error type, message, and resolution hints.

### General Guidelines

- **Do Not Assume Outcomes**  
  Network or timeout errors may leave the transaction state unknown.

- **Rely on Webhooks**  
  Webhooks provide authoritative confirmation of transaction outcomes and should be treated as the source of truth.

## Common Error Types

| Error Type | Description | Recommended Action |
|----------|------------|--------------------|
| **Invalid Request Error** | Request parameters are invalid, missing, or incorrectly formatted. | Review endpoint documentation and fix request payloads. |
| **Authentication Error** | API key is missing, invalid, or inactive. | Verify the API key and authorization headers. |
| **Permission Error** | API key lacks the required permissions. | Use a key with appropriate access or update role permissions. |
| **Rate Limit Error** | Too many requests sent within a short timeframe. | Implement retries with backoff or request higher limits. |
| **Connection Error** | Temporary network or connectivity issue. | Retry safely and rely on webhooks for final status. |
| **Server Error** | Internal error on Hyperrial’s side. | Retry later and monitor webhook events. |

By properly handling these errors and relying on webhooks for final state confirmation, you can build **resilient, fault-tolerant integrations** with the Hyperrial API.
