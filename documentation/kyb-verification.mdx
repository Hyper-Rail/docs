## Overview

At HyperRail, a **thorough verification process** is mandatory to ensure compliance with regulatory standards and platform policies.  
This process covers **Business Verification (KYB)** and **Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks** for all merchants and liquidity providers.

### KYB Verification (Know Your Business)

All registered entities must complete KYB to confirm **company legitimacy** and the authority of its representatives.

**Required Details:**

- **Company Registration Number**: Include supporting documents (e.g., Certificate of Incorporation)  
- **Tax ID**: Provide a valid Tax ID and supporting documents (Examples: EIN, VAT, GSTIN)  
- **Director/Owner Information**: Details of all directors or owners as per local laws

### Additional Information

Our compliance team may request additional documents or clarifications from time to time.  
Failure to provide these may result in **temporary restrictions on transactions or payouts**, but won’t block your account entirely.
