HyperRail is an **exchange and liquidity orchestration application** that allows businesses to move value between **fiat currencies and stablecoins** across global payment corridors.

It enables **on-ramping, off-ramping, and fiat-to-fiat exchange** using stablecoins as the settlement layer—while handling pricing, liquidity sourcing, and settlement internally.

HyperRail is built for businesses that need **fast, reliable, and transparent currency exchange**, without managing banks, blockchains, or liquidity providers directly.
